# React-Portfolio

## Description

This project is an updated version of my original portfolio, this time using React! 

## Usage

I couldn't get my website deployed. 

![Website sc](./src/assets/react-port-sc.JPG)

![portfolio sc](./src/assets/rp-port.JPG)

![contact sc](./src/assets/rp-contact.JPG)

![resume sc](./src/assets/rp-resume.JPG)

To use this site, you can click on the links on the navbar to switch between different pages. The links at the bottom will take you to the represented websites. Currently the portfolio links are not working and the resume is not downloadable.
